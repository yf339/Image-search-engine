# image-search-engine
Top 5 submission in 2018 CS5785 Machine Learning final Kaggle competition.
In this competition, we use different models and a variety of data preprocessing methods to achieve a large-scale image search engine, which can finally retrieve 20 most relevant images given a natural language query. By classifying, organizing and quantifying words in sentences, we compare the performance of the description and tag preprocessing method. In addition, we try many different machine learning models like Ridge regression, Partial Least Square Regression, KNN regression and many other models. We also use cross-validation to select optimal parameters, and observe the performance of the model on the test set. Through continuously optimizing, adjusting the details of each model and trying different ways to ensemble, finally we achieve a score of 0.45085 with 32 ensembled models.
